## by Alaa Saeed


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, BorrowerAPR distribution is mulitmodel there are several peaks small peak at 0.1 and large one at 0.2 another 2 peaks at 0.3 and 0.35. the relationship between loan amount and BorrowerARP is negative.
There is a strong relationship between Loan amount and monthly payment. there is strong effect on borrowerARP by Loan amount which when loan amount increases the borrowerARP decreases.
it turn out term has no effect on the relation between borrower ARP and loan amount because visualization of variables when term=60 and 36 almost the same.
but it affect on loan amount and monthly payment and when loan amount increases so as term variable increse monthly payment decrease.
i found out when i visualize Employment Status and Term there is only 36 and 60 months loans for employed borrowers. although, retired ,part-time employed borrowers only have 36 months loan. what surprise me is that There is a strong correlation between loan amount and monthly payment as LoanOriginalAmount increases, MonthlyLoanPayment increases. most likely monthly payment 1000$ and few how pay more than that.
when i tried to figure out the distribution of MonthlyLoanPayment i found it is skewed to the right. Most stated monthly payment are less than 1300,
distripution of loan amount shows there are several large peaks at 2500,5000,10000,15000,20000,25000 we can find every peak was increased by 5000 it increases at the same rate.
